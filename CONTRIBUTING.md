# Contributing to Valenthia Chronicles Projet

All contributions are welcome, and we appreciate your interest in helping 
to make the Valenthia Chronicles projet even better! 

However, to maintain a consistent vision and development direction for 
the game, the core team reserves the right to refuse any contribution. 
This decision will be made thoughtfully, with the overall coherence and 
quality of the project in mind.

**Note:** Before submission of any assets, you must be sure that you 
have full rights to those assets.

## Code of Conduct

All contributions must follow our [Code of Conduct][coc]. We will reject
contributions which violate the Code of Conduct, regardless of their technical
merit.


## Development Model

We develop using Git's branching model. To propose a contribution:

1.  [Fork][fork] the repository.

1.  [Clone][clone] the repository.

1.  [Open a Pull Request][pr] to propose your changes.

1.  Review an test output and linters, and address the issues. Because of how
    GitHub injects secrets into CI/CD, your _integration_ tests may fail. This
    is expected and our team will invoke the integration tests with our
    credentials. Other test types must pass.

1.  Our team will review the contribution. If it meets the project's goals and
    standards, we will likely accept the contribution.

    **For significant contributions or expanding scope, please open an issue
    first to ensure your contribution is in line with the project's goals.**
